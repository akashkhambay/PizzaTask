# PizzaTask
Added nav bar, buttons and got the 3 pages.
Following previous additions, the content required has been added.
Along with this we have added nicer looking buttons.
Going to now assess the responsiveness of the website, and see how we can alter such.
Now the changes that have been made, media query has been added so to change with the size of the webpage the background will change to a red color once a certain condition is satisfied.
Alterations are made to the nav bar, such to help with visibility and to also try and make the website look more stylish!
